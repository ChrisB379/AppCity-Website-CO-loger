<h2><a id="L1">How are Smoking and Carbon Monoxide Related?</a></h2>

<p>
Smoking tobacco increases the CO content of your blood. The normal level of CO for a non-smoker depends on background levels in the air
but it's usually between 0 and 8 parts per million. The level of CO for a smoker is usually much higher and varies according to the time 
of day, the number of tobacco products smoked and how the smoke is inhaled.
</p>

<h2><a id="L2">How Much Carbon Monoxide Enters the Body Through Smoking?</a></h2>

<p>
A person who smokes a pack of cigarettes per day will commonly have a CO level of about 20 parts per million. A two-pack-a-day smoker may have 
a level of about 40 parts per million.
</p>

<p>
The good news is that after stopping smoking, the CO level will return to normal within one or two days. Health effects related to CO may vary 
from person to person.</p>
 
<p>
CO enters the blood from the lungs and combines with hemoglobin, blocking the blood's ability to carry oxygen to body cells. Symptoms of CO exposure 
may mimic influenza and include fatigue, headache, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, mental confusion, and rapid heart rate. Depending on the level of 
exposure, Carbon Monoxide can be immediately fatal. Long-term, low-level exposure to Carbon Monoxide by pregnant women will injure the developing fetus.

<h2><a id="L3">What is Carbon Monoxide?</a></h2>

<p>
CO is a colorless, odorless, tasteless gas that is a small part of the air we breathe. There are many sources of CO such as incinerators, car exhaust 
and gas furnaces.

<h2><a id="L4">What are the Health Effects of Carbon Monoxide?</a></h2>

<p>
At high concentrations, CO can kill. People who are exposed to CO may experience headaches, dizziness, nausea (feeling sick) and tiredness. 
High concentrations can cause people to become confused. Continued exposure to a high concentration of CO can led to unconsciousness. When individuals 
are removed from the source of CO these symptoms usually improve. Exposure to lower concentrations of CO for a longer period may affect young people’s 
school work and an adult’s ability to concentrate and think clearly.
</p>

<p>
When the level of CO in your blood increases, the ability of your blood to carry oxygen is decreased. It is harmful to your body at any level and long-term 
exposure at lower levels can lead to heart disease.

<h2><a id="L5">What Symptoms Should I Look for if I Think I Have Been Exposed to Carbon Monoxide?</a></h2>

<p>
Headaches, tiredness, difficulty in thinking clearly and feeling sick are common symptoms of CO poisoning. Symptoms of CO poisoning 
can also be similar to those for food poisoning and the common cold.
